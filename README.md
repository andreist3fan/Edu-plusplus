# Edu++

### What is Edu++?

Edu++ is an educational platform developed by [Andrei Stefan](https://github.com/andreist3fan) and [Zamfir Cosmin](https://github.com/Cosmin0807) to serve as the main method of communication between teacher and student in online learning environments.
It is developed in C# using the .NET framework for developing desktop applications.

### Technologies used

Besides the usual C# libraries used, our application also uses the Firebase API, communicating in real-time with an on-line database to ensure safe account creation/login. Passwords are encrypted and stored safely.

### How to run

- Clone this Git repository on your machine;
- Using an IDE of your choice (preferrably Visual Studio), open the `Proiect Atestat.sln` file;
- Compile and run the project;
- Create an account and log in;
- You are all set!

To Note: This app was developed in May 2022 as part of a Computer Science certificate at the National College "Mihai Viteazul" of Ploiesti, so the main language for most of the UI is Romanian.
